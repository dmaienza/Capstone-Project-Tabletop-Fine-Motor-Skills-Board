# Capstone-Project-Tabletop-Fine-Motor-Skills-Board
Designed, tested, and produced a tabletop board consisting of mechanisms providing auditory, visual, and tactile feedback to the user to compensate for a lack of sensory experiences. Utilized an Arduino to interface different parts of the system: joystick, LED ring, LED strip, TFT Shield, slider, knob potentiometer, and vibration motors.

The seven different folders in this repository contain the programs created and tested in the development of this Capstone Project. The "MasterCode" file is the final implementation of all the subsystem programs that was ultimately ran on the Arduino Uno. The other six files represent their respective subsystem programs along with each iteration (adding additional features or exploring different solutions). The "CapstoneAudio" was a redacted subsystem that originally was intended to produce a stable sine wave up to 2kHz.

There are several libraries involved in the operation of these programs: Adafruit BusIO, Adafruit GFX Library, Adafruit NeoPixel, Adafruit seesaw Library, Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library, Fast LED, DueTimer, SineWave, and TimerOne.
