# Capstone-Project-Tabletop-Fine-Motor-Skills-Board
Designed, tested, and produced a tabletop board consisting of mechanisms providing auditory, visual, and tactile feedback to the user to compensate for a lack of sensory experiences. Utilized an Arduino to interface different parts of the system: joystick, LED ring, LED strip, TFT Shield, slider, knob potentiometer, and vibration motors.
